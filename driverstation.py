    First, let's see what we need to do about the AButton
    Let's just read the button from the controller and publish
    the state in NetworkTables
    I think, instead, we could store all of the buttons in a boolean array
    e.g. getBooleanArray().   That would takes less code. Keep in mind that pygame library might
    return different orders for the button array, so we might need
    to permute them based Window/Mac/Linux.

    Look at the documentation for NetworkTables for some ideas.
